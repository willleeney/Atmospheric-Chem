# Atmospheric-Chem
A series of .py files to procedurally generate alkane and alkene compounds. Also calculates vapour pressures and rate constants for interactive graphs. 

## Prerequisites
  Plotly needs to be installed as the graphs will be sent to your account. Please read the installation instructions here, 
  [link](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/). Every module in lib also needs to installed to run every file. If you just want to create graphs, then only pickle, pandas, and plotly need to be installed. 

## File Description
  * alkanes.py - calculates the alkane compounds
  * alkenes.py 	- calculates the alkenes and removes allenes 
  * my_funcs.py - functions used in more than one .py file
  * group_locs.py - precalculation for adding functional groups
  * calc_vps.py - calculates the vapour pressures
  * calc_rcs.py - calculates the rate constants
  * graph_drawing.py - draws interactive graphs 
  * save_data/ - storage for pickle files
