# Atmospheric-Chem
A series of .py files to procedurally generate alkane and alkene compounds. Also calculates vapour pressures and rate constants for interactive graphs. 

## File Describtion 
  alkanes.py - calculates the alkane compounds
	alkenes.py 	- calculates the alkenes and removes allenes 
  my_funcs.py - functions used in more than one .py file
  group_locs.py - precalculation for adding functional groups
  calc_vps.py - calculates the vapour pressures
	calc_rcs.py - calculates the rate constants
	graph_drawing.py - draws interactive graphs 
	save_data/ - storage for pickle files
